# Experiment to tweak source based on what rubocop wanted me to.  I basically
# gave up and made the following exceptions.  Personally, I find the tool did
# find many interesting/questionable code Qs in the project but it is soooo
# opinionated in pretty unimportant ways (like who cares how I write my
# comments, or why can't I use kind_of? or why give me a fail for a less
# readable but more performant pattern).
#
# I can obviously tweak rules (like below) but I keep hearing of people pulling
# their hair out over all the unimportant rules; I question why this project is
# "all-in" on it's rules versus leaving most of the style rules as some preset
# profiles people can opt in to.
#
# So I am committing this and I will try and run this every now and then to
# see what it thinks about what I wrote but you will not see this as a
# requirement for commits since I think by the time I configured it to my
# liking I could have finished implementing this library.  Perhaps if I
# continue using this here and there I will end up with a profile I find
# acceptable?  I did find value but all the piddly shit just made me angry.
# I will reflect on it some more...

# This is just impossible for them to call properly.  I am doing something
# like rotate_impl and it is a bunch of reasonably simple math.  If you look
# for this transformation in a text book it will look like this code.  Putting
# a bunch of math within different methods would get the score down but
# it would not help readability. (addendum: I did try and break it apart more
# and never reached 15 but got closer.  I felt this rule is neat but the
# score really depends on what it is.
